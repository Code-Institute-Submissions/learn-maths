# Mental Maths: Squaring
The webpage is useful for primary or high school students in mathematics. It explains in detail how to expand a binomial squared and the related product of conjugates by first providing a simple example. After that, there is a practice section and finally a challenge section where the student can apply the explained rules to mentally calculate squares and product of conjugates.

## Features
The Mental Maths web site has three sections:
- Example: 
    It shows how to calculate 23^2, 17^2 and 23 x 17 by breaking them up in more easily calculated parts, namely the squares of 20 and three, and the product of 20 and three twice. This illustrates the algebraic rules of expansion of a square and product of conjugates.

- Practice Area:
    Here the student can follow the previous example and enter a not to large number and apply the above mentioned rules to calculate the square of it. He will also calculate the related square and product. Under each calculation there is a button which turns green if every step of the calculation is correct, red otherwise. The student can practice as many times as he wishes. He cannot enter a number below 6 or a multiple of 10, partly because it becomes cumbersome and partly because the squares of them are easy to calculate anyway. When the student feels he is ready he can proceed to the challenge area.

- Challenge Area:
    The students can test his knowledge by calculating squares and product of conjugates mentally. The application generates a random number between 11 and 109 and chooses randomly between calculating a square or a product of conjugates. The question is displayed and the student has to enter the answer in an input box and press return. If the answer is correct the input box flashes green and the score and total number of trials are incremented by one. A new question is displayed and the process continues <em>ad infinitum</em>.

## Testing
- I checked that the application runs as expected both on PC and mobile. I verified that the input fields only accept numbers; that alerts are sent if the user enters a number less than six or a multiple of ten; that the color coding is correct and that the score is correct.
